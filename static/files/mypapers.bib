abstract="The presence of Long Distance Dependencies (LDDs) in sequential data poses significant challenges for computational models. Various recurrent neural architectures have been designed to mitigate this issue. In order to test these state-of-the-art architectures, there is growing need for rich benchmarking datasets. However, one of the drawbacks of existing datasets is the lack of experimental control with regards to the presence and/or degree of LDDs. This lack of control limits the analysis of model performance in relation to the specific challenge posed by LDDs. One way to address this is to use synthetic data having the properties of subregular languages. The degree of LDDs within the generated data can be controlled through the k parameter, length of the generated strings, and by choosing appropriate forbidden strings. In this paper, we explore the capacity of different RNN extensions to model LDDs, by evaluating these models on a sequence of SPk synthesized datasets, where each subsequent dataset exhibits a longer degree of LDD. Even though SPk are simple languages, the presence of LDDs does have significant impact on the performance of recurrent neural architectures, thus making them prime candidate in benchmarking tasks.",

ABSTRACT = {We challenge the upper bound of human-mobility predictability that is widely used to corroborate the accuracy of mobility prediction models. We observe that extensions of recurrent-neural network architectures achieve significantly higher prediction accuracy, surpassing this upper bound. Given this discrepancy, the central objective of our work is to show that the methodology behind the estimation of the predictability upper bound is erroneous and identify the reasons behind this discrepancy. In order to explain this anomaly, we shed light on several underlying assumptions that have contributed to this bias. In particular, we highlight the consequences of the assumed Markovian nature of human-mobility on deriving this upper bound on maximum mobility predictability. By using several statistical tests on three real-world mobility datasets, we show that human mobility exhibits scale-invariant long-distance dependencies, contrasting with the initial Markovian assumption. We show that this assumption of exponential decay of information in mobility trajectories, coupled with the inadequate usage of encoding techniques results in entropy inflation, consequently lowering the upper bound on predictability. We highlight that the current upper bound computation methodology based on Fano’s inequality tends to overlook the presence of long-range structural correlations inherent to mobility behaviors and we demonstrate its significance using an alternate encoding scheme. We further show the manifestation of not accounting for these dependencies by probing the mutual information decay in mobility trajectories. We expose the systematic bias that culminates into an inaccurate upper bound and further explain as to why the recurrent-neural architectures, designed to handle long-range structural correlations, surpass this upper limit on human mobility predictability.},

abstract={Mud Banks of Kerala are areas of the sea adjoining the coast that have a special property of dampening the waves and creating clearly demarcated areas of calm water during the roughest monsoon conditions of the sea. It is believed that these areas have a muddy bottom and suspended muddy sediments in the water column. The mere existence of mud in an area is not enough to form mud banks. However the mud of the right texture needs to get consolidated at the right depth where wave action could churn it up into a thick suspension (Gopinathan, C. K. et al. 1974). The mud banks are of socio-economic importance for the fisheries industry.},

        ease of access and reduce infrastructural investments, public
        transport authorities often adopt proof of payment system. Such
        a system operates by eliminating ticket controls when boarding
        the vehicle and subjecting the travelers to random ticket checks
        by affiliated personnel (controllers). Although cost efficient,
        such a system promotes free-riders, who deliberately decide to
        evade fares for the transport service. A recent survey by the
        association of European transport, estimates hefty income losses
        due to fare evasion, highlighting that free-riding is a serious
        problem that needs immediate attention. To this end, we
        highlight the attack vectors which can be exploited by free-
        riders by analyzing the crowdsourced data about the control-
        locations. Next, we propose a framework to generate randomized
        control-location traces by using generative adversarial networks

This analysis reveal that the number of interacting elements in a dependency is an important characteristic of LDDs.

  abstract={This article demonstrates the use of Maya, Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) for monitoring coastal waters, estuaries, rivers and dams. Maya is a mono hull structure with detachable nose and tail cones. The nose cone is mission specific, and offers the following sensor combinations: (a) dissolved oxygen and fluorometer, (b) conductivity temperature and depth, (c) hyperspectral irradiance, radiance and fluorometer. During a yoyo mission off-Goa in Nov 2006, a sensor suite (option c) was used to simultaneously measure the upwelling radiance (Lu) and down welling Irradiance (Ed) spectra, along with fluorescence Chlorophyll-a. The sampling frequency was 0.1 Hz. All sensors exhibited consistency during the various mission segments, consisting of surface, dive to 2m, cruise at 2m and accent to the surface. Maya was operated away from the mother ship, so as to decouple the optical measurements from all ship borne disturbances, like ship shadow and vibration of winch wire. Using the Ed and Lu spectra the hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), was derived along the mission track. Both irradiance and radiance, show an exponential decrease and increase respectively during the mission decent and assent segments. Fluorometer recorded chlorophyll-a values averaged at 0.52 ug/l. Water samples were collected along the path for estimating the Chlorophyll-a pigment using HPLC method. During another expedition at the SUPA dam in Karnataka during January 08, the spatial variations of dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a & backscatter was studied.},

We experimentally validate that this assumption inflates the estimated mobility entropy, consequently lowering the upper bound on predictability. We demonstrate that the existing approach of entropy computation tends to overlook the presence of long-distance dependencies and structural correlations in human mobility.

To explore this, we use English WordNet, constrained to the taxonomic (tree-like) portion of the graph, as a case study.
