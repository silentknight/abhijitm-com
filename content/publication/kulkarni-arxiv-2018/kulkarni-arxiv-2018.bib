 abstract = {Public transport network constitutes for an indispensable part of a city
by providing mobility services to the general masses. To improve
ease of access and reduce infrastructural investments, public
transport authorities often adopt proof of payment system. Such
a system operates by eliminating ticket controls when boarding
the vehicle and subjecting the travelers to random ticket checks
by affiliated personnel (controllers). Although cost efficient,
such a system promotes free-riders, who deliberately decide to
evade fares for the transport service. A recent survey by the
association of European transport, estimates hefty income losses
due to fare evasion, highlighting that free-riding is a serious
problem that needs immediate attention. To this end, we
highlight the attack vectors which can be exploited by free-
riders by analyzing the crowdsourced data about the control-
locations. Next, we propose a framework to generate randomized
control-location traces by using generative adversarial networks
(GANs) in order to minimize the attack vectors. Finally, we
propose metrics to evaluate such a system, quantified in terms
of increased risk and higher probability of being subjected to
control checks across the city.},
