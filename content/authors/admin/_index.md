I am a PhD candidate in deep learning Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin) and co-funded by ADAPT Research Centre, Ireland. My research includes exploring the impact of long distance dependencies (in sequential datasets) on neural architectures (sequential models). Previously, I worked with autonomous underwater vehicles and wireless sensor networks. 

I co-founded an IoT company in SpitiQ in Goa, India. I also provide technical assitance to Qubiseed Technologies LLP, Goa, India.
