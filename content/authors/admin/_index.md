I am a PhD candidate in deep learning at Technological University Dublin, Ireland and co-funded by ADAPT Research Centre, Ireland. I am a member of the Applied Intelligence Research Center, TU Dublin, Ireland. I study how neural language models (NLMs) represent data with long-distance dependencies (LDDs). Previously, I worked with autonomous underwater vehicles and wireless sensor networks.

I co-founded an IoT company SpitiQ, Goa, India. I also provide technical assistance to Qubiseed Technologies LLP, Goa, India.
