I am a PhD candidate in Deep Learning at the Applied Intelligence Research Centre (AIRC), Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin). I am co-funded by ADAPT Research Centre, Ireland. I am currently exploring the impact of long distance dependencies found in various datasets on neural architectures. Previously, I worked with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT). 

I co-founded an IoT based company in India named  SpitiQ. I also provide technical advice to Qubiseed Technologies LLP, India.
