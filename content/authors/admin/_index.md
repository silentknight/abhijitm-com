My research interests lie primarily in Natural Language Processing (NLP), specializing in Large Language Models (LLMs), where I work on Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Linguistics, and Information Theory. I am pursuing my research under the guidance of Prof. John D. Kelleher at Technological University Dublin, Ireland, co-funded by TU Dublin Research Award and a research grant by ADAPT Centre, Ireland. I was previously funded by an IBM shared university grant. I examine the complexity of long distance dependencies observed in sequential datasets and their impact on language models in an attempt to make them more efficient.

Previously, I worked with National Institute of Oceanography, Goa, India, where I worked with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV). I co-founded an IoT company, SpitiQ, Goa, India, where I was instrumental in building a home automation solution using Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSN). I also assisted Cyanodoc Healthcare, Goa, India, in developing a doctor's appointment application.
