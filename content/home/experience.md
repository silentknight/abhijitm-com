  Developed and maintained two robots (i) Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV-MAYA) and (ii) Autonomous Vertical Profiler (AVP), at Marine Instrumentation Division. Participated in field trials of AUV-MAYA and AVP.
  
  Developed, maintained, and updated AUV-MAYA which is designed on Linux SBC running Embedded Linux OS.
  Improved the wireless communication of AUV-MAYA by modifying communication protocol on TCP/IP.
  Implemented new algorithms to enhance the control, navigation, and communication of AUV-MAYA.
  Modified Linux drivers to interface Doppler Velocity Log Sensor, Attitude and Heading Resolution Sensor, and GPS RTK Sensor with the Embedded Linux OS running on AUV-MAYA.

  Developed Hardware-In-Loop (HIL) Simulator for AUV-MAYA.
  Developed a mathematical representation of the dynamics of the AUV-MAYA in MATLAB and C and simulated navigation sensor data of the AUV-MAYA.
  Modified the control program and electronics of the AUV-MAYA to incorporate the HIL Simulator.

  Developed a satellite communication portal for communication between AVPs deployed in remote locations (with no Wi-Fi or mobile network) and the servers located in the lab, to transmit the status and data of the AVPs.
  Installed a secure SELinux server and deployed a web server and a Python application to host the portal.
  Designed a protocol for the communication between the remotely deployed AVPs and the server via the Iridium satellite constellation. The protocol was designed using a Python application.
  Designed a data archival system in SQL for the data received from the remotely deployed AVPs.
  Designed a web app to display the real-time status of AVP and graphical plots of the data collected by the AVP.

  Developed graphical user interfaces on Windows and Android for AUV-MAYA and AVP to perform their missions.
  Developed a mission planner for AUV-MAYA that allowed the operator to plan mission paths for AUV-MAYA on Google Earth and converted them into mission files to be uploaded on AUV-MAYA.
