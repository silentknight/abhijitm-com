  Developed and maintained two robots (i) Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV-MAYA) and (ii) Autonomous Vertical Profiler (AVP), at Marine Instrumentation Division. Participated in field trials of AUV-MAYA and AVP.

  Improved the wireless communication of AUV-MAYA by modifying communication protocol on TCP/IP.
  
  Developed a Hardware-In-Loop (HIL) Simulator for AUV-MAYA.

  Developed a satellite communication portal for communication between AVPs deployed in remote locations (with no Wi-Fi or mobile network) and the servers located in the lab, to transmit the status and data of the AVPs and display their status on the website.

  Developed graphical user interfaces on Windows and Android for AUV-MAYA and AVP to perform their missions.

  Developed a mission planner for AUV-MAYA that allowed the operator to plan mission paths for AUV-MAYA on Google Earth and converted them into mission files to be uploaded on AUV-MAYA.
